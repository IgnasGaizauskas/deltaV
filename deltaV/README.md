A simple payload for selected deltaV solver for multi-stage and half-staged rockets. For most purposes https://launchercalculator.com/ is sufficient and better, but it doesn't support 1.5 stage rockets such as Delta Heavy. This code also ignores air drag and to compensate simply add +100m/s to the required deltaV. This gives results accurate within +-15%. There is also scaffolding code for air-breathing rockets that will be improved later.
